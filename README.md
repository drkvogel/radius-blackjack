# Radius Interview Python Programming Task

See spec.md for task specification

## What I would do if I had more time

* Use Test-Driven Development (`unittest`)
* Build an AI to play the dealer
* Provide a better UI - if not graphical, than at least a Text User Interface (TUI) rather than scrolling text
* Support multiple players across the network
* Provide a leaderboard
