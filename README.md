## Playing

run from the command line:

    $ chmod u+x blackjack.py
    $ ./blackjack.py

Press keys to play:

        "b": "bet",
        "d": "deal",
        "q": "Quit",
        "h": "Hit",
        "s": "Stand",

## Todo

* Use Test-Driven Development (e.g. `unittest`)
* Build an AI to play the dealer
* Provide a better UI - if not graphical, than at least a Text User Interface (TUI) rather than scrolling text
* Support multiple players across the network
* User testing
* Provide a leaderboard
